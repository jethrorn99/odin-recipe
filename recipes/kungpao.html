        "Easy to make and amazing flavors," according to one Allrecipes community member. "Preparation is everything as
        there is a lot of chopping. I added celery and a touch of ginger. Nice touch."

        "I made this by adding red bell pepper and chopped onion (didn't have green onions) because that's what our
        favorite Chinese restaurant does," says Lucy. "I also had to substitute garlic chili sauce for the chili paste."
